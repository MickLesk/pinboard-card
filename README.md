Pinboard is the pinboard in the hallway, as a card: the fridge with the
shopping list on its back, the boiler with its last service date, a plant with
its watering schedule, a family photo with a voice memo. The simplest card is a
picture with a note on its back; a tap (or a key press, a hover, or a timer)
turns it over with a 3D flip, a crossfade, a slide or a cube rotation. A card
can hold up to ten pictures, notes and recordings in any order.

## Features

- **Starter templates (1.1.0)** — add a shopping list, an editable family
  note or a maintenance note from the visual editor. Select your own
  entities; existing pages and card settings stay in place.
- **Setup tips (1.1.0)** — the editor explains missing or unavailable
  entities, read-only notes, missing note attributes and text length limits.
- **Upload a picture from the editor** — stored by Home Assistant, no `www`
  folder needed. URLs, `/local/` paths, `media-source://` ids and `image`,
  `camera` or `person` entities work too.
- **Notes in Markdown** — bold, lists, links, plus **templates** such as
  `{{ states('sensor.boiler') }}` that follow state changes.
- **To-do lists as pages** — a `todo.*` list becomes a checklist you tick and
  extend on the card. Items carry details, so a list also works as a stack of
  longer notes. Home Assistant keeps the list, so every device, the To-do view
  and automations see the same state.
- **History** — notes from entities show their last changes with time and
  person, straight from Home Assistant's logbook.
- **No Markdown required** — the editor's note box has buttons for bold,
  italic, heading, list, checklist and link, and a live preview.
- **Notes with a shelf life and a colour** — `expires` dims or hides a note
  after a date, `color` tints the page, and the sticky-note look makes notes
  read like a note on the fridge.
- **Edit the note on the card** — link an `input_text` or `text` entity and a
  pencil appears on the note side. Changes are saved with `set_value`, so
  automations and other dashboards see them immediately.
- **Up to ten pictures and notes per card, in any order** — picture, note,
  note, picture … Tap, swipe, arrows, dots, arrow keys or a timer move on to
  the next one. Or show them side by side as tiles that flip independently.
- **Markers on the picture** — numbered pins or icons with a label
  ("here is the stopcock"), optionally showing an entity's state and opening
  its more-info dialog. Placed by clicking in the editor.
- **A camera button on the card** — when a picture comes from an
  `input_text` entity, a tap on the camera takes or picks a new photo, uploads
  it and stores its address in the entity. No editor needed.
- **Voice memos** — an audio page with a player. Record in the editor, upload
  a file, or point `audio_entity` at an `input_text` and record straight on the
  card.
- **Ken Burns** — a slow zoom and pan on pictures for wall panels.
- **Five transitions** — `flip` (3D, default), `fade`, `slide`, `cube`, `none`;
  horizontal or vertical. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Fits every layout** — fixed aspect ratios or the picture's natural size,
  masonry and sections views, phone and wall panel.
- **Visual editor** for every option, grouped into sections. UI in English,
  German, Dutch, French and Spanish. Keyboard access throughout.
- **Try it first**: the [demo page](https://micklesk.github.io/pinboard-card/demo/)
  has six everyday examples and an interactive editor with simulated Home
  Assistant data. Technical examples are in a separate, collapsible section.

## Installation

Requires **Home Assistant 2024.10 or newer**. Pinboard is a dashboard card,
not a backend integration. HACS is optional.

[![Open in Home Assistant Marketplace](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/marketplace_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/marketplace_repository/?owner=MickLesk&repository=pinboard-card&category=plugin)

### HACS

[Open this repository in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=MickLesk&repository=pinboard-card&category=plugin),
or add it manually:

1. Open HACS, three-dot menu, **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/MickLesk/pinboard-card`, category **Dashboard**.
3. Install **Pinboard** and reload the browser when HACS asks.

HACS registers the resource automatically. If you manage resources yourself,
add `/hacsfiles/pinboard-card/pinboard-card.js` as a *JavaScript module*.

### Manual

Download **`pinboard-card.js`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/MickLesk/pinboard-card/releases/latest),
copy it to `/config/www/pinboard-card.js` and add
`/local/pinboard-card.js` under **Settings → Dashboards → Resources** as a
*JavaScript module*.

Use the built JavaScript file, not the release's source-code archive. Reload
the browser after installation or an update.

## Quick start

Add the card from the card picker (**Pinboard Card**) and use the visual
editor, or paste YAML. From version 1.1.0, open **Start with a template** to
add a shopping list, family note or maintenance note. Shared lists and
editable notes use an existing entity; the editor tells you how to create
one if none is available. Templates add a page, not a replacement for your
card. See [Templates and setup tips](docs/editor.md#templates).

The smallest useful card is a picture with a note on
its back:

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Boiler
image: /local/pictures/boiler.jpg
note: |
  **Last service:** 12 Oct 2025
  Next filter change in six months.
```

## Examples

Replace the example entity IDs with entities from your own Home Assistant.
Pictures can be uploaded in the visual editor instead of using `/local/`
paths.

### A shared shopping list

Use an existing Home Assistant to-do list. Everyone sees the same items,
whether they use this card, another dashboard or the built-in To-do view.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Shopping
todo_entity: todo.shopping_list
note: "For the next grocery run:"
note_style: sticky
color: yellow
```

### An editable household note

Create a Text helper under **Settings → Devices & services → Helpers** and
use its entity ID. The pencil on the card edits the helper's value; no
dashboard editing is needed.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Message for the family
note_entity: input_text.family_note
note_style: sticky
color: blue
```

Text helpers hold at most 255 characters, and their configured maximum may
be lower. For longer notes, use the details of items in a to-do list.

### A family pinboard

Show a photo with a note on its back, a shared task list and a separate
Markdown note as tiles in one card.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Family pinboard
layout: grid
columns: 2
note_style: sticky
slides:
  - image: /local/pictures/family.jpg
    title: This week
    note_entity: input_text.family_note
    color: yellow
  - todo_entity: todo.family_tasks
    title: Things to do
    color: green
  - note: |
      ## Before leaving
      Keys, lunch and a water bottle.
    title: By the front door
    color: blue
```

## Full configuration

Every option, with its default where one exists. Only `type` is required.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Garage                      # shown on pictures and above notes

# --- pages ------------------------------------------------------------------

## Options

### Card

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | – | `custom:pinboard-card`. Required. |
| `title` | – | Shown on pictures and above notes. Pages without their own `title` use it. |
| `slides` | – | Pictures, notes and recordings in order, at most ten pages. See [Page](#page). `images` is accepted as an older name. |
| `image`, `image_entity`, `note`, `note_entity`, `note_attribute`, `audio`, `audio_entity`, `expires`, `color`, `markers`, `kind` | – | The single-entry form: the same keys as one `slides` entry, placed on the card. Ignored when `slides` is set. |
| `layout` | `stack` | `stack` shows one page after another, `grid` shows the entries side by side as tiles that each turn on their own. |
| `columns` | `0` | With `layout: grid`: tiles per row. `0` fits as many as the width allows (about 150 px each). |
| `aspect_ratio` | `16:9` | `16:9`, `4:3`, `3:2`, `1:1`, `3:4`, `9:16`, any `w:h`, or `auto` for the picture's natural size. In sections view the card fills its rows instead. |
| `image_fit` | `cover` | `cover` fills the card and crops, `contain` shows the whole picture. |
| `transition` | `flip` | `flip`, `fade`, `slide`, `cube` or `none`. Replaced by a short fade when the system asks for reduced motion. |
| `direction` | `horizontal` | `horizontal` or `vertical`, for `flip`, `slide` and `cube`. |
| `duration` | `700` | Animation length in milliseconds. |
| `default_side` | `image` | Start on the first picture (`image`) or the first note (`note`). |
| `auto_flip` | `0` | Turn to the next page every *n* seconds. `0` disables it. `auto_advance` is an older name. |
| `hover_flip` | `false` | Show the next page while the pointer hovers over the card. Mouse devices only. |
| `swipe` | `true` | Swiping left and right on the card turns pages. The card keeps those touches to itself, so swipe-navigation plugins do not change the view instead. Set to `false` to let swipes over the card reach the dashboard. |
| `ken_burns` | `false` | Slow zoom and pan on pictures. Off under "reduce motion". |
| `show_title` | `true` | Title overlay on pictures. |
| `show_hint` | `true` | The badge in the corner that names the next page. |
| `show_navigation` | `true` | Arrows and dots when there are more than two pages. Swiping and the arrow keys always work. |
| `show_updated` | `true` | "Updated … ago" for notes and recordings that come from an entity. |
| `note_style` | `plain` | `plain` or `sticky`. Sticky notes get a paper tint and a folded corner. |
| `sticky_color` | – | Paper colour of sticky notes: a preset name (`yellow`, `green`, …) or any CSS colour. Without it the paper is yellow in light themes and ochre in dark ones. |
| `expired_slides` | `dim` | What happens to pages past their `expires`: `dim` keeps them greyed out with an "Expired" tag, `hide` removes them from the sequence. |
| `checklist` | `true` | Lines like `- [ ] item` become checkboxes. Ticks are saved for notes from an `input_text` / `text` entity; in notes from the card config the boxes are read-only. |
| `checklist_writeback` | `true` | Save ticks on notes from an `input_text` or `text` entity to the entity. |
| `todo_add` | `true` | Input row on to-do pages for adding items. |
| `todo_show_completed` | `true` | Keep completed to-do items visible below the open ones, struck through. |
| `show_history` | `true` | History button on notes from entities: the last changes with time and person, from the logbook. |
| `show_expand` | `true` | Enlarge button in the footer when a page does not fit the card, and a long press opens the same popup unless a hold action is set. |
| `upload_target` | `image` | Where the editor's upload button and the camera and record buttons store files: `image` (Home Assistant's image store) or `media` (the media folder). Audio always goes to the media folder. |
| `upload_folder` | `pinboard` | With `upload_target: media`: the folder below `/media`. Created on the first upload. |
| `upload_max_size` | `1920` | Longest edge in pixels that pictures are scaled down to before upload. `0` keeps originals. |
| `upload_crop` | `false` | Centre-crop pictures to `aspect_ratio` before upload. |
| `show_camera` | `true` | Camera button on pictures whose `image_entity` is an `input_text` / `text` entity. |
| `show_record` | `true` | Record button on audio pages whose `audio_entity` is an `input_text` / `text` entity. |
| `tap_action` | `flip` | Action for a tap. See [Action](#action). |
| `hold_action` | `none` | Action for a long press. |
| `double_tap_action` | `none` | Action for a double tap. Only when set is a double tap awaited, so a single tap stays instant otherwise. |

### Page

One entry of `slides`, or the single-entry keys on the card. An entry with a
picture, a note and a recording yields three pages, in that order. A bare
string is treated as `image`.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | card `title` | Title of this page. |
| `image` | – | Picture URL, `/local/` path, `/api/image/serve/…` URL or `media-source://` id. Uploads from the editor land here. |
| `image_entity` | – | Picture from an `image`, `camera` or `person` entity, or from an `input_text` / `text` entity whose state is a picture address. The latter gets a camera button. |
| `note` | – | The note in Markdown. Checklists and templates work. Ignored when `note_entity` is set. |
| `note_entity` | – | Note from an entity's state. `input_text` and `text` entities are editable on the card. |
| `note_attribute` | – | Read this attribute of `note_entity` instead of its state. Read-only. |
| `todo_entity` | – | A `todo.*` list shown as a checklist. Ticks and new items go to the list. `note` becomes the text above it. |
| `audio` | – | URL or `media-source://` id of an audio file. |
| `audio_entity` | – | Audio from an `input_text` / `text` entity whose state is the audio address. Gets a record button. |
| `expires` | – | `2026-10-01` or `2026-10-01 18:00`. Until then the footer shows "Until …"; afterwards the page is dimmed or hidden. |
| `color` | – | Tint of a note page: `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `pink`, `orange`, `purple`, `grey` or any CSS colour. Presets switch to a darker shade while Home Assistant uses a dark theme. |
| `text_color` | `auto` | Text on a note page: `auto` picks dark or light for contrast with `color`, `light` and `dark` force it, any CSS colour works too. |
| `qr` | – | Draws a QR code on the note page above the text: a link, a Wi-Fi string (`WIFI:T:WPA;S:name;P:password;;`) or any text. An entry with only `qr` is a QR page. |
| `qr_entity` | – | The QR content comes from this entity's state instead; an empty state shows no code. |
| `markers` | – | A list of pins on the picture. See [Marker](#marker). |
| `kind` | – | `image`, `note` or `audio`. Only needed for an entry that has no content yet; the editor sets it. |
| `visible` | – | One condition or a list: `{ entity, state }`, `{ entity, state_not }` or `{ entity, attribute, state }`. `state` may be a list. Without `state` the page shows whenever the entity is available. The page is only part of the sequence while every condition holds. |
| `tap_action`, `hold_action`, `double_tap_action` | card's | Per-page overrides of the card's actions. |

### Marker

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x`, `y` | – | Position in percent of the picture's width and height. Required. |
| `label` | – | Text shown when the pin is tapped. |
| `icon` | – | An `mdi:` icon instead of the number. |
| `entity` | – | Its state is added to the label; a tap on the label opens the more-info dialog. |

### Action

The same objects Home Assistant's own cards use, plus `flip`.

| `action` | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `flip` | Show the next page. Default for `tap_action`. |
| `expand` | Open the card enlarged in a popup, on the current page. |
| `more-info` | Open the more-info dialog of `entity`, defaulting to the page's `note_entity`, then `image_entity`. |
| `toggle` | Toggle `entity` (same default). |
| `navigate` | Go to `navigation_path`; `navigation_replace: true` replaces the history entry. |
| `url` | Open `url_path` in a new tab. |
| `perform-action` | Run `perform_action` with `data` and `target`. `call-service` with `service` still works. |
| `none` | Nothing. |

`confirmation: true` or `confirmation: { text: "…" }` asks before an action
runs.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Custom element doesn't exist: pinboard-card"**: check that the
  JavaScript module resource is registered and its URL loads. Reload the
  browser; after an update, a hard refresh may be needed to clear a cached
  bundle. Avoid registering both the manual and HACS resource.
- **Checkboxes cannot be changed**: checklists written directly in card YAML
  are read-only. Use `todo_entity` for a shared task list, or `note_entity`
  pointing to an `input_text` / `text` entity for a writable Markdown
  checklist.
- **A note has no edit button**: editing requires an `input_text` or `text`
  entity. Notes read from an attribute via `note_attribute` are read-only.
- **Voice recording does not start**: allow microphone access and open Home
  Assistant in a secure browser context, normally HTTPS. Browser support and
  permissions also matter; uploading an audio file in the editor is an
  alternative.
