# Pages and content

A Pinboard card is a sequence of up to ten pages. A page is a picture, a note
or a recording. The simplest card has two pages, a picture and the note on
its back; a tap turns to the next page and wraps around at the end.

## Pictures

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Boiler
image: /local/pictures/boiler.jpg
```

`image` accepts a URL, a `/local/` path (files in `/config/www/`), the
`/api/image/serve/<id>/original` address the editor's upload produces, or a
`media-source://media_source/local/…` id for files in `/media`. Media-source
ids are resolved through the media source API and renewed before the signed
URL expires.

`image_entity` takes the picture from an entity instead:

- `image.*` and `camera.*` entities show their latest frame and refresh when
  the entity updates.
- `person.*` entities show their profile picture.
- `input_text.*` and `text.*` entities are read as a picture address. This
  enables the [camera button](#taking-photos-on-the-card).

`aspect_ratio` and `image_fit` control the frame; `ken_burns: true` adds a
slow zoom and pan for wall panels.

## Notes

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Fridge
image: /local/pictures/fridge.jpg
note: |
  **Milk** is running low.
  Buy 2 litres on Friday.
```

Notes are Markdown, rendered by Home Assistant's own markdown element:
bold, lists, links, headings.

### Notes from entities

`note_entity` reads the note from an entity's state. With an `input_text` or
`text` entity a pencil appears on the note page and the note can be edited on
the card; the change is saved with `set_value`, so every dashboard and
automation sees it. `note_attribute` reads an attribute instead of the state
and is read-only.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Front door
image_entity: camera.front_door
note_entity: sensor.last_visitor
note_attribute: message
```

The footer shows when the note was last changed (`show_updated`).

### To-do lists

The proper way to keep a list is a Home Assistant to-do list. Create one under
*Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Local To-do* (or use a
Google Tasks, Todoist or shopping list entity) and point a page at it:

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
image: /local/pictures/fridge.jpg
todo_entity: todo.shopping
note: "Before the weekend:"
```

The page shows the open items as checkboxes, the completed ones struck
through below (`todo_show_completed`), and an input row for new items
(`todo_add`). Every item can carry details: the pencil next to an item opens
title and details for editing (with the formatting buttons) and offers
deletion. Details are shown under the item, so a to-do list doubles as a stack
of longer notes without the 255-character limit of `input_text`. Ticks call `todo.update_item`, new items `todo.add_item`, so the
list stays the same on every device, in Home Assistant's To-do view and for
automations. The list's name is used as the page title when the page has
none; `note` is shown as text above the list.

### Checklists in note text

Lines like `- [ ] Bread` and `- [x] Milk` in a note become checkboxes. When
the note comes from an `input_text` or `text` entity the tick is written back
to the entity (`checklist_writeback`). In a note from the card configuration
the boxes are read-only, because there is nowhere to keep the tick; use a
to-do list for that. `checklist: false` renders them as plain Markdown.

### Templates

Anything with `{{ … }}` or `{% … %}` is rendered by Home Assistant and updates
live:

```yaml
note: "Boiler at **{{ states('sensor.boiler_temp') }} °C**, last error: {{ states('sensor.boiler_error') }}"
```

Templated notes do not write checklist ticks back, because the text changes
under them.

### Expiry

`expires` gives a page a shelf life. Until then the footer shows "Until 1
Oct"; afterwards the page is dimmed and tagged "Expired", or removed from the
sequence with `expired_slides: hide`. A bare date expires at the end of that
day, local time.

```yaml
slides:
  - note: Parcel at the neighbour's.
    expires: "2026-10-01"
```

### Colours and sticky notes

`color` tints a note page: `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `pink`, `orange`,
`purple`, `grey` or any CSS colour. Text switches to light or dark to stay
readable; `text_color` overrides that with `light`, `dark` or any CSS colour.
`note_style: sticky` on the card gives all notes a paper tint and a folded
corner.

### History

Notes from an entity get a history button in the footer (`show_history`). It
lists the last changes of the last 30 days with the time and the person who
made them, taken from Home Assistant's logbook. Changes by automations show
as "Automation or system". Repeated identical values are collapsed.

### Writing notes without Markdown

The note box in the editor and the inline editor on the card have buttons for
bold, italic, heading, list, checklist and link; the editor also shows a live
preview. Plain text works as it is, the buttons only add the Markdown marks.

## Markers

Pins on a picture point at things and say what they are:

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Boiler room
image: /local/pictures/boiler.jpg
markers:
  - x: 30
    y: 45
    label: Stopcock
    icon: mdi:water-off
  - x: 72
    y: 30
    label: Pressure
    entity: sensor.boiler_pressure
  - x: 85
    y: 85
    entity: sensor.boiler_temp
```

A pin shows a number or its `icon`. A tap opens its label; with `entity` the
label also shows the state and a tap on the label opens the more-info dialog.
In the editor, click on the preview to add a pin, select a pin and click again
to move it, and fill in label, icon and entity in the list below.

## Taking photos on the card

Point `image_entity` at an `input_text` (or `text`) entity. The card shows
that entity's state as the picture address and adds a camera button. On a
phone the button opens the camera, elsewhere a file picker; the picture is
scaled down (`upload_max_size`), optionally cropped (`upload_crop`), uploaded
to the chosen `upload_target` and its address is written into the entity with
`set_value`. Automations can do the same: any URL, `/local/` path or
`media-source://` id works as a state. `show_camera: false` hides the button.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Damage report
image_entity: input_text.damage_photo
note_entity: input_text.damage_note
```

## Voice memos

An audio page shows a player with a big play button, a progress bar you can
tap to seek, and the title. Three ways to fill it:

- **Record in the editor.** *+ Audio*, then *Record*. The browser asks for
  the microphone; *Stop* uploads the memo to the media folder
  (`upload_folder`) and fills in the address. Recording works in Chrome,
  Firefox and Safari 14.5 or newer.
- **Upload an audio file** or paste a URL / `media-source://` id into
  `audio`.
- **Record on the card.** Point `audio_entity` at an `input_text`. The page
  gets a microphone button; a tap records (up to three minutes), a second tap
  stops, uploads and writes the address into the entity. Requires an
  administrator account for the media upload. `show_record: false` hides the
  button.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Message for Dad
slides:
  - image: /local/pictures/kids.jpg
  - audio_entity: input_text.kids_memo
```

## Several pages

`slides` lists pages in any order. An entry with several parts (picture, note,
audio) becomes one page per part, in that order.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Holiday
slides:
  - image: /local/pictures/arrival.jpg
    title: Arrival
  - note: "Day 1: **arrived** late, the hotel is fine."
  - note: "Day 2: hiking. Bring water."
  - image: /local/pictures/lake.jpg
    title: Lake
  - note_entity: input_text.holiday_shopping
    title: Shopping
auto_flip: 15
```

Tap, swipe, the arrows, the dots and the arrow keys move between pages;
`auto_flip` runs a slideshow. Touches that start on a card with more than one
page stay inside the card, so dashboards with swipe navigation (for example
the "swipe-navigation" HACS plugin) do not switch views when you swipe over
it. `swipe: false` hands those swipes back to the dashboard. With more than two pages, arrows and dots appear
on pictures (`show_navigation`). On note pages the arrows stay hidden so they
never sit on the text.

## Conditional pages

A page can depend on an entity. It joins the sequence while the condition
holds and leaves it otherwise, so a card can show the doorbell camera only
while someone is at the door, or a "heating fault" note only while the boiler
reports one.

```yaml
slides:
  - image: /local/pictures/door.jpg
  - image_entity: camera.door
    title: Someone rang
    visible:
      entity: binary_sensor.doorbell
      state: "on"
  - note: "Boiler error: {{ states('sensor.boiler_error') }}"
    color: pink
    visible:
      - entity: sensor.boiler_error
        state_not: ["none", "0"]
```

`state` accepts a single value or a list, `state_not` the opposite,
`attribute` compares an attribute instead of the state, and a condition
without `state` holds whenever the entity is available. Several conditions
must all hold. The editor offers one entity and state per page; lists and
attributes are YAML only.

## Actions per page

`tap_action`, `hold_action` and `double_tap_action` on a page override the
card's actions on that page, for example a hold on the camera page that opens
the camera's more-info dialog while other pages keep the default.

## Tiles

`layout: grid` shows the entries side by side inside one card. Every tile is
a complete card of its own that turns between its picture, note and audio.
`columns` fixes the tiles per row; `0` fits as many as the width allows.

```yaml
type: custom:pinboard-card
title: Garden
layout: grid
columns: 2
slides:
  - image: /local/pictures/tomatoes.jpg
    title: Tomatoes
    note: Water every second day.
  - image: /local/pictures/lawn.jpg
    title: Lawn
    note_entity: input_text.lawn_note
```
